# Environment Agency Metadata Profile (EAMP)

The Environment Agency Metadata Profile (EAMP) extends the UK Gemini Metadata Profile for the Environment Agency, including two additional elements:

 * **Approval for Access (AfA) status**: This is an additional access constraint element using a controlled vocabulary to define 
the outcome of an Environment Agency legal process decision as to whether or not data and information within the data source is legally safe to share.
 * **Approval for Access (AfA) code**: This is an additional element required alongside the AfA Status to indicate the process-derived unique identifier associated with the data source.
